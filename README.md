  - Static site
  - Score saving to local storage
  - Technical task:
        1. A page is displayed for entering a user name using the
           HTML element "input".
        2. Then - the static page displays the "glass" for the tetris using the HTML element "canvas", 
           it is also used to display the
           next figure, user name and glasses are displayed.
        3. Figures in game - classical figures of a tetris (7 pieces tetramino).
        4. Randomly the figure is generated and starts to fall in "glass".
           ([for a description of the rules, see, for example,](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Тетрис)).
        5. The user has the ability to move the figure to the left and right, rotate to
           90° and "drop".
        6. If a whole "string" is gathered, it must disappear.
        7. When dialing a certain specified number of points increases the level, that
           is to increase the speed of the game.
        8. The user loses when the glass is "filled", after which he
           the local record table is displayed.
        9. All logic of the application is written in JavaScript, design using
           CSS.
